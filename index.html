		  			<p> The web is comprised of the following pieces:</p>
		  			<ul>
		  				<li><b>Web Browser</b> - A disply program on a computer to display content.
		  				<li><b>Servers</b> - Computers that host files.
		  				<li><b>Http</b> - Communication protocol. 
		  				<li><b>Internet</b> - A network of computers.

			      	</div>
			      	<div class ="sub-lesson-desc">
			      		<p>HTML is the heart of the web and is composed of the following parts:</p>
			      		<ul>
			      			<li><b>Text</b> - This is basically what gets displayed. <br>
			      			<li><b>Markup</b> - This controls the style of the text that is diaplyed. <br>
			      		</ul>
			      		<p> An HTML may also contain references to other kinds of documents such as images and video. It may also contain links to other pages.</p>

		      		Markup
		      	</div>
		      	<div class ="sub-lesson-desc">
		      		<p> A Markup element is made of an opening tag, a content and closing tags. Opening tags may have values. Some markups do not have contants and are said to be void markups. Void tags do not need closing tag. </p>

		      		<p>Some example of tags:</p>
		      		<ul>
		      			<li><b>&#60;a&#62;</b> - anchor for making links <br>
		      			<li><b>&#60;img&#62;</b> - for images and has src and alt attributes<br>
		      			<li><b>&#60;br&#62;</b> - page break<br>
		      			<li><b>&#60;p&#62;</b> - make paragraphs
		      		</ul>

		      		<p>The difference between the line break and paragraph tag is that the first one is an inline tag while the latter is a block tag. </p>

		      			<li>The Body is basically where the content of the document is written.

		      		<p> All elements of a website are in boxes. The first thing you need to do when you start converting a graphic design into a webpage is to decide the boxes that will need to be created. Afterwards you populate the boxes with content.</p>
		      		
		      		<p>Boxes are created with the div tag. To help add style to the boxes, include a class attribute to each box. The names should be indicative of the purpose of the box to avoid confusion lateron.</p>

	  				<p>CSS stands for <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heets. It is used to control the style of the HTML elements using selectors which can either be defined inside the HTML or in a separate file.</p>

	  				<p>The basic advantage of CSS is that it helps us to avoid repition, which helps to make the code good and concise.</p>

		      		<p>Whenever you write code, first start with the big picture and drill down to the details. Always look for repeated styles to avaoid repition.</p>
